This is the implementation of the Artificial Bee Colony algorithm that optimizes high dimensional continuous model parameters. 

author: Andrej Aderhold, 2009

The method was introduced in   

Aderhold, Andrej, et al. "Artificial bee colony optimization: A new selection scheme and its performance." Nature Inspired Cooperative Strategies for Optimization (NICSO 2010). Springer Berlin Heidelberg, 2010. 283-294.

and is also featured in 

Diwold, Konrad, et al. "Performance evaluation of artificial bee colony optimization and new selection schemes." Memetic Computing 3.3 (2011): 149-162.


The directory 'ABC' contains the Java implementation besides various other Artificial Bee Colony selection and location update schemes. 


Additional implementations are located in the following folders. I keep them together with ABC since they served as benchmark.
