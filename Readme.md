This is the implementation of the Artificial Bee Colony algorithm that optimizes high dimensional continuous model parameters. 
Copyright (C) 2009 by Andrej Aderhold


The method was introduced in   

Aderhold, Andrej, et al. "Artificial bee colony optimization: A new selection scheme and its performance." Nature Inspired Cooperative Strategies for Optimization (NICSO 2010). Springer Berlin Heidelberg, 2010. 283-294.

and is also featured in 

Diwold, Konrad, et al. "Performance evaluation of artificial bee colony optimization and new selection schemes." Memetic Computing 3.3 (2011): 149-162.


The directory 'ABC' contains the Java implementation besides various other Artificial Bee Colony selection and location update schemes. 


Additional implementations are located in the following folders. I keep them together with ABC since they served as benchmark and include slight modification.
